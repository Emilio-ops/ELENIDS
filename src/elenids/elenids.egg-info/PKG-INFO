# Elenids
This is a network-based, anomaly-based, passive intrusion detection system.
The system uses an ensemble of classifiers to classify netowork traffic.
The system is implemented using UNSW-NB15 dataset and works with packages collected using the same tools.
The data should be preprocesse using the same process of the UNSW-NB15.
This package offers two distinct systems, obtainable using:
1. build(): offers a votingClassifier obtained combining four classifiers: DT,RF,KNN,MLP.
2. Fastbuild(): offers a votingClassifier obtained combining three classifiers: DT,RF,MLP.

The first is slower but is more reliable, while the second is faster but slightly less reliable.
