This is the official directory for the Data mining for cyber security project.

To use the ids classification alghoritm you should before dawnload the following libraries:
1. Panda;
2. Sklearn;
3. Numpy.

To visualize the ids' statistics the following libraries are required:
1. matplotlib.pyplot;
2. Time.

To download the dataset (it is mandatory), please refer to this link: https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/personal/z5025758_ad_unsw_edu_au/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fz5025758%5Fad%5Funsw%5Fedu%5Fau%2FDocuments%2FUNSW%2DNB15%20dataset%2FCSV%20Files%2FTraining%20and%20Testing%20Sets&ga=1

The ids classification alghoritm does not require anything else. It produces several excel files.
A complete implementation should also collect the packets from the network and pass them to the classification algorithm, but this is ouside the scope of our research.
